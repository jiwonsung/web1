  <h2>Production</h2>
  <p>
    By early 2012, several Hollywood studios were keen to obtain film rights to The New York Times bestselling Fifty Shades trilogy of novels.[16] Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Universal, and Mark Wahlberg's production company submitted bids for the film rights.[17][18] Universal Pictures and Focus Features secured the rights to the trilogy in March 2012.[5] Author James sought to retain some control during the movie's creative process.[19] James chose The Social Network producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti to produce the film.[4][20]

Although American Psycho writer Bret Easton Ellis publicly expressed his desire to write the screenplay for Fifty Shades of Grey,[21] Kelly Marcel, screenwriter of Saving Mr. Banks, was hired for the job.[22] Patrick Marber was brought in by Taylor-Wood to polish the screenplay, specifically to do some "character work".[23] Universal hired Mark Bomback for script doctoring.[24] Mark Bridges served as the costume designer.[25] Entertainment Weekly estimated the film's budget as "$40 million-or-so".[26]
