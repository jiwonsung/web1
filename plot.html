  <h2>Plot</h2>
  <p>
    21-year-old Anastasia "Ana" Steele is an English literature major at Washington State Universityâ€™s satellite campus near Vancouver, Washington.
    When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire entrepreneur, for the college newspaper,
    Ana agrees to go in and takes her place. At Christian's Portland headquarters Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU commencement speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.
